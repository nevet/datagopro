Testing before releasing/deploying code is a good practice for every coder. Besides corner cases, testing the code against random data is usually a cheaper way to verify the robustness of a code. However, writing the data generator sometimes is not a pleasant and trivial task, and usually doubles the headache: how to make sure the data itself doesnâ€™t contain any flaws? DataGoPro aims to provide a sophisticated data generation scheme to help every coder to generate suitable and abundant random input for specific problems.
